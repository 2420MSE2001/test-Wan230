      # This is where you place your autograding tests
      # For more information on this runner, see the documentation at: https://github.com/classroom-resources/autograding-io-grader
      #
      # For example, you could run a test suite like this:
      # - name: Run tests
      #   uses: classroom-resources/autograding-io-grader@v1
      #     with:
      #       test-name: Addition Test
      #       id: addition-test
      #       command: "./bin/add.sh"
      #       input: 1 2
      #       expected-output: 3
      #       comparison-method: exact
      #       timeout: 10

      # For more information on this runner, see the documentation at https://github.com/classroom-resources/autograding-grading-reporter
      # To output the results of the tests, you can use the
      # autograding-grading-reporter action like this:
      # env:
      # ADDITION-TEST_RESULTS: "${{ steps.addition - test.outputs.result }}"
      #     with:
      #         runners: addition-test
